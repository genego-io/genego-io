### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Edwin, I am a software developer native in Python and Django, as well as HTML and Javascript. 

I also actively work on the [Konfuzio server](https://help.konfuzio.com/modules/index.html) and with the [Konfuzio SDK](https://github.com/konfuzio-ai/konfuzio-sdk)

I'm currently most interested in AI, intelligent document processing (IDP) and figuring out how I can make LLM's do my work for me.
