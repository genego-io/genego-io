### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer who loves to work with Python, Django & HTMX. I also actively work on the [Konfuzio server](https://help.konfuzio.com/modules/index.html) and [SDK]

I like working on new and interesting things, I see this repository and my [website](https://edwin.genego.io) as a digital garden to cultivate.
