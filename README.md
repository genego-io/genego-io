### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech expert, and software developer, who mostly works with Django & Python frameworks. 

My main interests currently steers me towards the IDP (intelligent document processing) and AI. 

Slowly I am starting to develop a love for writing technical documentation as well as other technical writing as well as blogging.

Outside of the confounds of my home-office and my CLI, I mostly spend time practicing martial arts and traveling.
