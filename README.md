### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Edwin, I'm software developer who loves to work with [Python](https://github.com/python), [Django](https://github.com/django/django) & [HTMX](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx). 

I also actively work on the [Konfuzio server](https://help.konfuzio.com/modules/index.html) and with the [Konfuzio SDK](https://github.com/konfuzio-ai/konfuzio-sdk)

I'm currently most interested in AI, OCR, building API's and automating systems.
