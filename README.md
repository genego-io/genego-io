### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech export, and software developer, who mostly works with Python & Django frameworks. 

My main interests currently steers me towards the IDP (intelligent document processing) and AI. 

Slowly I am starting to develop a love for writing technical documentation as well as other technical writing as well as blogging.

Outside of the confounds of my home-office and my CLI, I mostly spend time practicing martial arts, traveling and getting my tastebuds aquanted to ever increasing spicyness which is Thai food.
